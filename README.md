## Special Session on Machine Learning for Wireless Communication Systems at IJCNN 2022

The aim of this special issue is to bring together researchers working at the intersection between machine learning and wireless communication (WiC) systems.

Future generations of WiC networks hold many promises: ever-larger data rates, unprecedented guarantees of ultra-reliable and low-latency wireless links, new Internet of Things (IoT) systems, networks of drones and self-driving cars. To hold up to these promises, the wireless ecosystem is evolving towards an incredibly complex and heterogeneous system which poses many new challenges compared to previous generations. A promising approach to successfully handle such a magnitude of complexity and data volume is to develop new network management and optimization tools based on Machine Learning (ML). However, while ML has made tremendous progress over the last decade, traditional methods for optimization and management of wireless systems cannot scale efficiently to the magnitude of complexity and heterogeneity of future wireless connectivity while providing the quality of service that is expected. These challenges have promoted some preliminary investigations which open to a number of possible developments.

This special issue will be an opportunity to expose these and other recent trends in ML for communication systems, and to identify novel trends inspired by the limitation of current approaches to WiC networks.

Future WiC networks must handle (1) immense growth of the wireless traffic due to connectivity of billions of devices (2) massive increase in antenna densification to absorb the upcoming traffic surge while responding to the (3) necessity for high data rates and reliability of services, (4) the fact that future wireless networks will comprise novel sensing and data collection services, (5) non-ideal data availability (irregular time series with gaps and outliers), (6) limited computational and communication dedicated to learning, (7) complex interactions among protocols working at different time scales.
